Okay, this GitHub Actions workflow looks like a good starting point for deploying your "Project Board" application to an
AWS EC2 instance. Let's break down the workflow, identify potential improvements, and discuss best practices.

Overall Structure:

The workflow is triggered on pushes to the main branch. It consists of a single job named deploy that runs on an Ubuntu
runner. The job includes steps to:

 1. Checkout the code.
 2. Set up Node.js.
 3. Install pnpm and pm2.
 4. Copy the code to the EC2 instance using scp.
 5. Execute commands on the EC2 instance via ssh to install dependencies, build the project, and restart the server
    using pm2.

Improvements and Best Practices:

Here's a detailed look at each section with suggestions for improvement:

 * Security Considerations:
   
   * secrets.EC2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: Storing the private key directly as a GitHub secret is acceptable for smaller projects
     or personal use. However, for larger or more sensitive projects, consider using AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
     or HashiCorp Vault to manage secrets, which offer better auditing and access control.
   * Firewall: Ensure your EC2 instance's security group is configured to only allow SSH access from your specific IP
     address or a limited range of IPs. Opening it to the world exposes you to potential attacks. Also, restrict
     HTTP/HTTPS traffic to only the necessary ports (80, 443).

 * Workflow Logic:
   
   * Node.js Version Management: The workflow installs Node.js both with actions/setup-node@v4 and via nvm on the EC2
     instance. This is redundant and could lead to inconsistencies. Choose one method and stick with it. I recommend
     relying solely on nvm within the EC2 instance for consistency with your server environment. Remove the
     actions/setup-node@v4 step.
   * strip_components: 1: This is good for removing the top-level directory when copying. Make sure this matches your
     intended behavior. Double-check that the files are being placed in the correct location on the EC2 instance.
   * Dependency Caching: You can significantly speed up deployments by caching dependencies between workflow runs. Use
     GitHub Actions' caching mechanism.
   * Error Handling: The || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Node 22 not installed via NVM" is a good start, but you should consider more robust
     error handling. For instance, the ssh-action will still proceed even if nvm use 22 fails. Consider using set -e in
     your SSH script to exit immediately if any command fails.
   * Atomic Deployment: The current approach can lead to downtime if the build process takes a while. Consider using a
     more atomic deployment strategy, such as deploying to a new directory, then symlinking it to the live directory
     after the build is complete.
   * Health Checks: Implement health checks in your application and configure pm2 to monitor and restart your
     application if it becomes unhealthy.

Revised Workflow (with improvements):

name: Deploy Project Board to AWS EC2

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to EC2
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Cache pnpm modules
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.pnpm-store
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('pnpm-lock.yaml') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-

      - name: Deploy to EC2 via SCP
        uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.EC2_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.EC2_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.EC2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          source: "."
          target: "/var/www/webapps/project-board"
          strip_components: 1

      - name: Restart Server via SSH
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.EC2_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.EC2_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.EC2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          script: |
            set -e # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.

            export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
            [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && source "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

            # Install NVM if not present
            if ! command -v nvm &> /dev/null
            then
                echo "Installing nvm..."
                curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
                export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
                [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && source "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
            fi

            nvm use 22

            cd /var/www/webapps/project-board

            echo "‚úÖ Node version: $(node -v)"

            echo "üì¶ Installing dependencies..."
            pnpm install

            echo "‚öôÔ∏è Building project..."
            pnpm build

            echo "üöÄ Starting or restarting PM2 process..."
            pm2 restart api-server || pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs
            pm2 save


Explanation of Changes:

 * Caching: Added caching for pnpm modules using actions/cache. This will drastically reduce installation times on
   subsequent runs. The cache key includes the pnpm-lock.yaml file, so the cache is invalidated when dependencies
   change.
 * set -e: Added set -e to the beginning of the SSH script. This ensures that the script exits immediately if any
   command fails, preventing cascading errors.
 * NVM Installation Check: Added a check to see if NVM is installed. If not it will proceed with the installation before
   running the script.
 * Removed redundant Node setup: Removed the actions/setup-node step.
 * Simplified NVM Usage: Assumed nvm is the primary method for managing Node.js versions on the EC2 instance.
 * Idempotent NVM installation: Added an installation of NVM to the remote server if it is not installed.

Next Steps and Considerations:

 1. Test Thoroughly: After implementing these changes, test the workflow thoroughly in a non-production environment
    before deploying to production.
 2. Monitor Deployment: Monitor the deployment process to identify and address any issues that may arise.
 3. Rollback Strategy: Have a rollback strategy in place in case a deployment fails or introduces unexpected problems.
    This could involve reverting to a previous commit or using a blue-green deployment strategy.
 4. CI/CD Pipeline: Consider expanding your CI/CD pipeline to include automated testing (unit, integration, and
    end-to-end) to catch errors early in the development process.
 5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): For more complex deployments, consider using IaC tools like Terraform or
    CloudFormation to manage your AWS infrastructure in a declarative way. This will make it easier to reproduce your
    environment and manage changes.
 6. Containerization (Docker): Consider containerizing your application using Docker. This will ensure that your
    application runs consistently across different environments and simplifies deployment.

By implementing these improvements, you can create a more robust, efficient, and secure deployment pipeline for your
Project Board application. Remember to adapt these suggestions to your specific needs and environment. Good luck!
